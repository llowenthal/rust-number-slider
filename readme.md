# Intro
I wanted to see if I could write a simple application for KDE Plasma using rust. ChatGPT recommended using Qt. ChatGPT helped me along the way from a hello world application to a simple counter with a sliding bar.

# Installation
```
sudo pacman -S --needed rust cargo base-devel qt6-base qt6-declarative
git clone https://github.com/llowenthal/rust-number-slider.git
cd rust-number-slider
cargo run
```
